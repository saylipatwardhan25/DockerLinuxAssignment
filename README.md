#Five DevOps Concepts


1.Continuous Integration (CI) – Automatically builds and tests code whenever changes are made, ensuring errors are caught early.

2.Continuous Delivery (CD) – Automates the deployment process so code can be safely released to production anytime.

3.Containerization – Packages applications with all dependencies into isolated containers, making them portable and consistent across environments.

4.Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Defines and manages infrastructure using code, allowing versioning and reproducible setups.

5.Version Control – Tracks and manages code changes, enabling collaboration, history tracking, and easy rollbacks using Git.

## 2. Steps I Followed

### Project Structure
```
DockerLinuxAssignment/
 ├── Dockerfile
 ├── run.sh
 └── README.md
```

### Docker Commands Used
```
docker build -t linux-commands .
docker run linux-commands
```

### Git Commands Used
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Docker Linux Assignment"
git branch -M main
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:saylipatwardhan25/DockerLinuxAssignment.git
git push -u origin main
```

#How This Assignment Helped Me

1.DevOps: Gained hands-on experience with automation and pipelines, understanding how Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery streamline software development.

2.Linux: Practiced essential Linux commands and operations inside Docker containers, which improved my command-line skills and system management knowledge.

3.Git: Learned how to manage version control effectively, including initializing repositories, staging changes, committing, branching, and pushing to remote repositories.

4.Docker: Built and ran containerized environments, understanding how containers isolate applications and dependencies, making deployment consistent across different systems.

5.Problem-Solving & Workflow: Improved my ability to troubleshoot issues, follow structured workflows, and integrate multiple tools (Linux, Git, Docker) in a real-world scenario.
