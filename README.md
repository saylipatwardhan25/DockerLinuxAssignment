# Docker Linux Assignment

## 1. Five DevOps Concepts
1. Continuous Integration – Automating code builds and testing.
2. Continuous Delivery – Automated deployment pipeline.
3. Containerization – Running applications inside isolated containers.
4. Infrastructure as Code – Managing infrastructure using code.
5. Version Control – Tracking and managing code changes using Git.

## 2. Steps I Followed
